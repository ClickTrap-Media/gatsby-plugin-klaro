The plugin adds the necessary configuration and script in the head of your page.

## How to install

### Install the plugin through npm
The installation of `gatsby-plugin-klaro` is done the same way as you would install other plugins.
Refer to [Using a plugin in your site](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/using-a-plugin-in-your-site/) for a detailed guide.
Note that you need `npm` to use this plugin. You might also use another prefered package manager that you currently use.

Run the following commandto install `gatsby-plugin-klaro`:
```
npm install gatsby-plugin-klaro
```

### Load the plugin
Put the plugin into your `gatsby-config.js`. It is **important** that you insert the plugin at the top of
your loaded plugins. The order of the plugins in your `gatsby-config.js` specifies their load order.
As Klaro is a CMP it is recommended to put it at the top of your `<head></head>`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        ...
        {
            `gatsby-plugin-klaro`,
            options: {
                ...
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
};
```

## Available options

### `klaroVersion` (optional, default: `v0.7.11`)
The version of Klaro that should be used. Use the same version strings as you find
on [Releases](https://github.com/kiprotect/klaro/releases) on the Klaro repository.
Example value: "v0.7.11"

### `klaroUrl` (optional, default: offical klaro url with `klaroVersion` as version)
The Klaro url that should be used to load the Klaro script.
You can use %version% as a placeholder for `klaroVersion`.
The following example shows how to use a local Klaro version that lays in your static content folder.

### `config` (required if `configUrl` is not set)
The configuration that you want to apply to Klaro.
This value is a JSON object that contains the necessary configuration of Klaro.
You can either use the `config` **or** `configUrl` option to configure Klaro.
Note that `config` has a higher priority than `configUrl` and will override `configUrl`
if both options are set. Also no configuration merging will be applied.
Example value: {...}

### `configUrl` (required if `config` is not set)
The URL to a JavaScript file that should be loaded as configuration source.
Please use the default variable when in your JavaScript configuration file
which is `window.klaroConfig` for this to work properly.

Note that `config` has a higher priority than `configUrl` and will override `configUrl`
if both options are set. Also no configuration merging will be applied.
